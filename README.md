# usable-transcripts

:construction: Very much under construction. Not ready for use. :construction:

:question: Equity requirements in higher education make the provision of transcripts from videos important. Current processes for generating those transcripts are less the ideal and somewhat onerous. Something this important should be simpler and better.

ðŸŽ¯ Produce a usable method for providing transcripts for videos from as many sources as possible.


### Getting started

1. Clone the template repository
2. `npm install`
3. Modify settings

### Modify settings

1. Pick a name for your App and rename `App.svelte` and other stuff??
2. Update the name of the repo in `meta.js`



## Example

As an example, the existing code produces a script that adds a `hello world` message to the top of the _Modules_ and _Rubrics_ pages of a Canvas course.
